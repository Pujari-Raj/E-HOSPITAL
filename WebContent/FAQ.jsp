     You should select India for your medical treatments as the advantages for medical treatments in India include reduced costs, availability of latest medical technologies, and a growing compliance with international quality standards, as well as the fact that foreigners are less likely to face a language barrier in India. 
     The Indian government is taking strong positive steps to address infrastructure issues that hinder the country's growth in medical tourism.
